A deep dive into the data has newly revealed a hotbed of young stars in an elusive stage of development. This discovery may help us investigate how stars like our Sun form, as well as how radiation from nearby massive stars might affect the development of planets.<br/>Webb was able to detect the signatures of extremely young stars, never before seen. Stars at this early stage of development are hidden inside clouds of dust and gas, and are only visible in infrared light and with high resolution instruments. <br/>These young stars interact with their environments by taking in material and then ejecting some of it. The ejections, in the form of jets and outflows of matter, heat the surrounding hydrogen gas (H2, or molecular hydrogen), causing it to emit light.<br/><br/><span class=\"credits\">Credits: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Megan Reiter (Rice University), with image processing by Joseph DePasquale (STScI), Anton M.

    "description": "By combining images of the iconic Pillars of Creation from two cameras aboard NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope, the universe has been framed in its infrared glory. Webb‚Äôs near-infrared image was fused with its mid-infrared image, setting this star-forming region ablaze with new details.<br/>Myriad stars are spread throughout the scene. The stars primarily show up in near-infrared light, marking a contribution of Webb‚Äôs Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam). Near-infrared light also reveals thousands of newly formed stars ‚Äì look for bright orange spheres that lie just outside the dusty pillars.<br/>In mid-infrared light, the dust is on full display. The contributions from Webb‚Äôs Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) are most apparent in the layers of diffuse, orange dust that drape the top of the image, relaxing into a V. The densest regions of dust are cast in deep indigo hues, obscuring our view of the activities inside the dense pillars.<br/>Dust also makes up the spire-like pillars that extend from the bottom left to the top right. This is one of the reasons why the region is overflowing with stars ‚Äì dust is a major ingredient of star formation. When knots of gas and dust with sufficient mass form in the pillars, they begin to collapse under their own gravitational attraction, slowly heat up, and eventually form new stars. Newly formed stars are especially apparent at the edges of the top two pillars ‚Äì they are practically bursting onto the scene.<br/>At the top edge of the second pillar, undulating detail in red hints at even more embedded stars. These are even younger, and are quite active as they form. The lava-like regions capture their periodic ejections. As stars form, they periodically send out supersonic jets that can interact within clouds of material, like these thick pillars of gas and dust. These young stars are estimated to be only a few hundred thousand years old, and will continue to form for millions of years.<br/>Almost everything you see in this scene is local. The distant universe is largely blocked from our view both by the interstellar medium, which is made up of sparse gas and dust located between the stars, and a thick dust lane in our Milky Way galaxy. As a result, the stars take center stage in Webb‚Äôs view of the Pillars of Creation.<br/>The Pillars of Creation is a small region within the vast Eagle Nebula, which lies 6,500 light-years away.<br/>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin‚Äôs Advanced Technology Center.<br/>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.<br/><span class=\"credits\">Credits:</span><br/>SCIENCE: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI<br/>IMAGE PROCESSING: Joseph DePasquale (STScI), Alyssa Pagan (STScI), Anton M.

Countless white stars, interspersed with yellow and orange background galaxies of various shapes, dot the black background. One prominent galaxy is a pale yellow spiral in the top left corner of the image. Another defining feature is a large white star with long diffraction spikes, seen just to the right of the top center.<br/>In this brand new image of dwarf galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM), the Webb telescope demonstrates its remarkable ability to resolve faint stars outside the Milky Way. <br/>Just 3 million light-years from Earth, WLM is considered a dwarf galaxy in our galactic neighborhood. While it is close, it‚Äôs much more isolated than other nearby galaxies, which interact with our own Milky Way. WLM also has a similar chemical makeup to galaxies in the early universe, meaning it‚Äôs poor in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Because WLM is small and low-mass, supernovae (star explosion) events can be powerful and energetic enough to expel heavier elements out of the galaxy.<br/>Taken altogether, these traits make WLM ideal for studying how stars form and evolve in small galaxies, similar to those in the early universe. The science here is complementary to what we learn by looking at the farthest and oldest galaxies, which appear as they were when they first formed.<br/><br/>This post highlights data from Webb science in progress, which has not yet been through the peer-review process.<br/><span class=\"credits\">Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, and Kristen McQuinn (Rutgers University) </span>",

The Cartwheel is composed of two rings, a bright inner ring and a colorful outer ring. Both rings expand outward from the center of the collision like shockwaves.<br/>However, despite the impact, much of the character of the large, spiral galaxy that existed before the collision remains, including its rotating arms. This leads to the &quot;spokes&quot; that inspired the name of the Cartwheel Galaxy, which are the bright red streaks seen between the inner and outer rings. These brilliant red hues, located not only throughout the Cartwheel, but also the companion spiral galaxy at the top left, are caused by glowing, hydrocarbon-rich dust.<br/>In this near- and mid-infrared composite image, MIRI data are colored red while NIRCam data are colored blue, orange, and yellow.
